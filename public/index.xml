      <description>Technologies I learned for LFX I saw the notary project in the LFX mentorship website and I knew most of the technologies needed for the project, hence I decided to participate in LFX through the notary project. after I forked the project and cloned it to my machine, I realized most of the website is coded in something similar to HTML. I already had an experience with React and Django, so I could understand most of the codebase.</description>

      <description>Why LFX I am very passionate about open-source and LFX, that is the reason why immediately once the project was announced, I started learning Golang(I thought we need Golang in order to work with Hugo) and then I learned Hugo, SCSS, Figma and I made a few projects in these technologies so to become proficient in these technologies in order to contribute to the project better. Now I am confident enough to contribute to the project since I have learned Hugo and Figma.</description>
