# GirlScript Summer of Code

GirlScript Summer Of Code is a three-month-long Open-Source Program conducted every summer by the GirlScript Foundation. There were about 13000+ Participants from 14+ countries in GirlScript Summer of Code 2023, out of which I managed to be among Top 100.

In this 3-months long program. I learned how to contribute to complex open-source projects and how to create for the maintainers by writing effective Pull Requests and issues, I learned how to work in team with people all over the globe, and I also gained experience around different technologies.

Thing I got to learn:

- Practical experience of Git and GitHub
- Working in teams and solving issues together
- Understanding a codebase
- Navigating the codebase and raising appropriate issues
  
## GSSoC Top 100 Contributors

Out of 13000+ contributors, I was among the top 100 contributors in the entire program. This was possible due to the hard work I put it being consistent.
