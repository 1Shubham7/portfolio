## Why LFX

I am very passionate about open-source and LFX, that is the reason why immediately once the project was announced, I started learning Golang(I thought we need Golang in order to work with Hugo) and then I learned Hugo, SCSS, Figma and make few projects in these technologies so to become proeficent in these technologies in order to contribute to the project better. I feel now I understand the codebase and am ready to contribute.
