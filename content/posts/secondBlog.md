## Technologies I learned for LFX

I saw the notary project in the  LFX mentorship website and I knew most of the technologies needed for the project, hence I decided to participate in LFX through the notary project. after I forked the project and cloned it to my machine, I realized most of the website is coded in something similar to HTML. I already had an experience with React and Django, so I could understand most of the codebase. Then I researched about the language and framework being used and I go to know that it was Hugo and that Hugo is based on Golang. Therefore I started learning Golang, it took me 1 week (since I already knew 3 Languages it was eaiser for me). Then I started learning Hugo and Figma and simultaneously building websites along with it.
