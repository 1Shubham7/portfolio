## Technologies I learned for LFX

I saw the notary project in the  LFX mentorship website and I knew most of the technologies needed for the project, hence I decided to participate in LFX through the notary project. after I forked the project and cloned it to my machine, I realized most of the website is coded in something similar to HTML. I already had an experience with React and Django, so I could understand most of the codebase. Then I researched about the language and framework being used and I go to know that it was Hugo and that Hugo is based on Golang. Therefore I started learning Golang, it took me 1 week (since I already knew 3 Languages it was eaiser for me). Then I started learning Hugo and Figma and simultaneously building websites along with it.

As of now these are the technologies I am proefecient at that I can use to contribute to the Notary Project -

1. HTML
2. SCSS
3. Hugo
4. Figma
5. Git

Some Other Programming languages, Technologies and tools I know that are not directly related to this project are -

1. Django
2. React
3. Linux
4. Bash
5. Android Studio
6. Java
7. Golang
8. Python
9. Anaconda
10. Javascript
