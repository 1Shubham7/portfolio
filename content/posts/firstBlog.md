## Why LFX

I am very passionate about open-source and LFX, that is the reason why immediately once the project was announced, I started learning Golang(I thought we need Golang in order to work with Hugo) and then I learned Hugo, SCSS, Figma and I made a few projects in these technologies so to become proficient in these technologies in order to contribute to the project better. Now I am confident enough to contribute to the project since I have learned Hugo and Figma.

** Why do I need LFX mentorship?**

There are 2 reasons why I need LFX mentorship: Mentorship and community. I read this in the LFX mentorship website that "LFX Mentorship makes it easy to sponsor and help train the next generation of open source developers by serving key needs of the community." through LFX, I hope to get to be part of such communities. Secondly, mentorship from my mentor will surely help me in my open-source journey. Through LFX mentorship, I will get a chance to implement my skills under the mentorship of a mentor, and that will significantly help me in my open-source journey.
